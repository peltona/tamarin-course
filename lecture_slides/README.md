# Lecture Slides

This directory contains Beamer files for generating the lecture slides. Note that there are currently no Beamer files for the last two lectures.

In `./slides/`, you can find the slides used in the 24/25 iteration of the course.

## Generating slides

Generate slides for a specific lecture (e.g., lecture 0):

```bash
$ make LECTURE=0
```

Generate all lecture slides:

```bash
$ make all
```

Remove temporary files:

```bash
$ make clean
```
